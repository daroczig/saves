Description: The purpose of this package is to be able to save and load
    only the chosen variables/columns of a data.frame in special binary
    files (tar archives) - which seems to be a lot faster method than
    loading the whole binary object (Rdata files) via load() function,
    or than loading columns from SQLite/MySQL databases via SQL
    commands. The performance improvement gained by loading only the
    chosen variables in binary format can be useful in some special
    cases, but be sure you really need this, as non-standard file
    formats are used!
